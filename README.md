# Watch Mongo and Redis

This repo contains handy scripts which make it easy to watch change streams of data in your cloud dev environmentâ€™s Redis and Mongo databases. This can help with understanding what keys are used for caching information, as well as what data changes are associated with actions you take from the FE, especially in areas of the codebase that are unfamiliar to you.

There are 2 more READMEs in the project that go into more depth.
